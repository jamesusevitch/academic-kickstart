abstract: Many algorithms have been proposed in prior literature to guarantee resilient multi-agent consensus in the presence of adversarial attacks or faults. The majority of prior work present excellent results that focus on discrete-time or discretized continuous-time systems. Fewer authors have explored applying similar resilient techniques to continuous-time systems without discretization. These prior works typically consider asymptotic convergence and make assumptions such as continuity of adversarial signals, the existence of a dwell time between switching instances for the system dynamics, or the existence of trusted agents that do not misbehave. In this paper, we expand the study of resilient continuous-time systems by removing many of these assumptions and using discontinuous systems theory to provide conditions for normally-behaving agents with nonlinear dynamics to achieve consensus in finite time despite the presence of adversarial agents.
