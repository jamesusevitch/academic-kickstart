abstract: "There has been recent growing interest in graph theoretical properties known as r- and (r, s) -robustness. These properties serve as sufficient conditions guaranteeing the success of certain consensus algorithms in networks with misbehaving agents present. Due to the complexity of determining the robustness for an arbitrary graph, several methods have previously been proposed for identifying the robustness of specific classes of graphs or constructing graphs with specified robustness levels. The majority of such approaches have focused on undirected graphs. In this paper we identify a class of scalable directed graphs whose edge set is determined by a parameter k and prove that the robustness of these graphs is also determined by k. We support our results through computer simulations."
