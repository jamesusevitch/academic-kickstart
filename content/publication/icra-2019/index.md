abstract: "The property of resilience describes the ability of a multi-agent system to mitigate the effects of adversarial attacks or faults. A growing body of resilient control techniques based upon the Mean-Subsequence-Reduced (MSR) class of algorithms have been proposed which enable the consensus of normally behaving agents despite attacks and faults. Impressive results have been obtained using these algorithms, but there is still much potential for future research. In this paper, several recent contributions of the authors to this area are summarized including results dealing with robustness determination, resilient leader-follower methods, and incorporating finite-time convergence into resilient control. We conclude with several opportunities for future work."
