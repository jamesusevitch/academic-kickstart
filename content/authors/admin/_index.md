I'm a PhD Candidate in the Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of Michigan. My advisor is Professor [Dimitra Panagou](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dpanagou/index.html). My main research focus is on algorithms which provably guarantee the safety and security of multi-agent cyber-physical systems. My work has been published in several competitive, peer-reviewed conferences including the 56th, 57th, and 58th IEEE Conferences on Decision and Control, the 2017 and 2018 American Control Conferences, and the _Resilient Robot Teams: Composing, Acting, and Learning_ independent workshop at the 2019 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation. My journal papers have been accepted for publication in the IEEE _Transactions on Automatic Control_ and in _Automatica_. I'm a Student Member of the IEEE.
